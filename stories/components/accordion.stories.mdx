# Atlas Accordion

Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout our applications and experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage. The following palette provides the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.

Color is at the foundation of what makes Atlas a truly Cision design system. Rooted in the brand palette, we have expanded the choices to give designers freedom to explore combinations and ranges to fit their particular contexts.

### When to use

Primary colors are used for key components across the UI. Such as buttons, input fields, tabs, surfaces.
Secondary colors are used for less prominent components in the UI, such as filter chips, while expanding the opportunity for color expression.
