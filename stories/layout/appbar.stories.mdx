# Atlas AppBar Layout

The `AppBar` is a user interface element typically found at the top of the software application window,
used to provide quick access to functions, navigation options, and information. It can contain various
components such as a title or logo, navigation icons, search functions, menus, and buttons for commonly
used functions or settings. The appearance and functionality of the `AppBar` can vary depending on the
design and purpose of the application.

### When to use

The `AppBar` is typically used in software applications to provide quick access to frequently used functions,
navigation options, and information. It is particularly useful when an application has a lot of
functionality and features, and users need a quick and easy way to access them.
