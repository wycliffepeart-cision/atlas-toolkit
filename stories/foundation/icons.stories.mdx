# Atlas Icons

Icons are crucial for guiding our users through important tasks in our applications and experiences. They should be instantly recognizable and memorable as well as consistent in design, line weight and color.

Primarily used for navigation, icons also serve as key functions for things like editing, chatting or checking notifications.

### When to use

Primarily icons are used for navigation and other functions that can be easily represented by symbols and make the interface more efficient.
