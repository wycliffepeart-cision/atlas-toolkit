# Getting Started

Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout our applications and experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage.
The following palette provides the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.

Color is at the foundation of what makes Atlas a truly Cision design system. Rooted in the brand palette, we have expanded the choices to give designers freedom to explore combinations and ranges to fit their particular contexts.

**Install using npm**

```bash
npm install github:cision/atlas-toolkit
```

**Install using yarn**

```bash
yarn add github:cision/atlas-toolkit
